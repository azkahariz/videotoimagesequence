# Video to Image Sequence using C++
This program will convert your video to grayscale image sequence based on frame per second in your video.

#### Dependency

- OpenCV 3.4.4 (In this program I used Library OpenCV 3.4.4). I think different library also can do it.
- QT Creator (I used QT Creator, because I not yet learn about C++ compiling etc.).
- C++

### Take It Easy
You can use this program and develop it together. Cheers!
